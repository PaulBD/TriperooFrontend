      <p>Triperoo UK Ltd ("Triperoo" or "we"), operates a single website located at http://www.triperoo.co.uk and provides mobile and other device-based applications on various platforms, including, without limitation, Android and iOS (collectively, the “App”), and provides services through the Sites and through the App (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are hosted in the United Kingdom. These Terms of Use, as may be modified by Triperoo from time to time (the “Terms”), constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Triperoo that applies to your Triperoo account and your use of the App and the Services, including any viewing or submission of content in the Services.</p>
      <h5>1. Your Agreement to these Terms.  </h5>
      <p>By accessing or using the Services and/or the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms, whether you are a "Visitor"
        (which means that you browse or use the Services without registering for a Triperoo) or you are a "Member" (which means
        that you have registered for a Triperoo account). The term "User" refers to another user of the Services (not you),
        whether a Visitor or a Member. You are authorized to use the Services and the App only if you agree to abide by
        all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("Applicable Law") and these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by
        these Terms and to abide by all Applicable Law, you must discontinue use of the Services and uninstall the App
        immediately. Your use of, or participation in, certain Services may be subject to different or additional terms,
        and such terms will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up for or use such Services.</p>

      <h5>2. Modifications to these Terms.</h5>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time and from time to time, and each such modification shall be
        effective upon posting on the Services. Your continued use of the Services and/or App following any such modification
        constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the Terms as so modified. It is therefore important that
        you review these Terms regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by any modifications to these Terms, you must
        discontinue use of the Services and uninstall the App immediately. If we ask you to provide your express consent
        to any modifications to these Terms and you do not provide such consent, we may terminate your access to the Services
        and the App.</p>

      <h5>3. Eligibility to Use Services.</h5>
      <p>Use of the Services and registration to be a Member for the Services ("Membership") is void where prohibited. Our Services
        and App are not intended for children. By using the Services and/or the App, or by registering for Membership, you represent
        and warrant to us that you are 13 years of age or older and that your use of the Services and App does not violate any
        Applicable Law. In addition, by registering for Membership, you further represent and warrant to us that all registration
        information you submit is truthful and accurate, and that you will update such information as and when necessary to keep
        it accurate and up to date.</p>

      <h5>4. Termination.</h5>
      <p>These Terms (including any modifications, as set forth above) shall remain in full force and effect while you use the
        Services and App or are a Member. You may terminate these Terms and, if applicable, your Membership at any time, for any
        reason, by contacting us. By terminating your Membership, you acknowledge and expressly agree that we may, in our
        discretion, irrevocably delete all of your profile content, photos and other content or information you have submitted to
        the Services (collectively, “Content”), as well as your Membership account information. We may suspend or terminate your
        Membership and/or terminate these Terms at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation,
        and without liability. Upon termination of these Terms by you or us, you may no longer access or use the Services or the
        App in any way; and any provision of these Terms that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such
        termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, this sentence and Sections 6-9 and 11-22.</p>

      <h5>5. Member Registration.</h5>
      <p>In order to register for Membership, you are required to fill out the registration form by providing all required
        information, and choose a username and password that you can modify at any time. You are solely responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password
        of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to notify us immediately if
        you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password. You are solely responsible for any and all
        use of your account.</p>

      <h5>6. Fees.</h5>
      <p>We reserve the right to charge for any portion of the Services and/or App and to change our fees (if any) from time to
        time in our discretion. If we terminate your Membership because you have breached these Terms, you shall not be
        entitled to the refund of any unused portion of fees or payments (if any).</p>

      <h5>7. Personal Use Only.</h5>
      <p>The Services and the App are for individual personal use only, except that a business that is represented as a point of
        interest on the Services may register for Membership for the business solely: (a) to interact constructively with
        Users who have reviewed the business in the Services; (b) to access the Business Owner Tools provided by us;
        or (ciii) as otherwise expressly authorized by us in writing. You may not use any part of the Services for any
        other commercial purposes, including, without limitation, to advertise, promote, review, or link to any business
        in which you have a financial interest (whether as an owner, manager, shareholder, officer, director, employee,
        affiliate, or contractor, or a family member of any of the foregoing). We reserve the right to remove commercial
        content from the Services in our sole discretion. Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Services, including,
        without limitation, collecting User information by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited
        email or unauthorized framing of or linking to the Services, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, affiliate
        links, and other forms of unauthorized data collection or solicitation may be removed without notice or explanation
        and may result in termination of your Membership. We reserve the right to take appropriate legal action for any
        illegal or unauthorized use of the Services.</p>

      <h5>8. Rights in Content You Submit.</h5>
      <p>We do not assert ownership of your Content. As between you and us, you own your Content. By posting any Content
        on, through or in connection with the Services, you hereby grant to us a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
        fully-paid, perpetual, assignable license (with right to sublicense) to use, modify, create derivative works of,
        delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on, through or in
        connection with the Services, including, without limitation, distributing part or all of the Services and any
        Content included therein, in and/or through any and all media, platforms, and distribution channels now or
        hereafter known or developed. Without limiting that license grant, you acknowledge and agree that we may
        sublicense Content, in whole or in part, to third parties to permit such third parties to display content
        from the Services. You may terminate this license to your Content by terminating your Membership account
        (which terminates this license as to all of your Content) or by removing Content from the Services (which
        terminates this license as to the Content removed). Upon receipt of notice of such termination by you, we
        will remove your Content from the Services as soon as practicable, and at that point our license to your Content
        under these Terms will terminate, except with respect to any Content that we cannot reasonably retrieve or
        delete (for example, copies that have been saved or otherwise retained by third parties outside of the Services). You
        represent and warrant that: (a) the Content is your original work or you otherwise own the Content or have all
        rights necessary to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms, and (b) the posting of the Content on,
        through or in connection with the Services and the granting of the rights in these Terms do not violate the
        privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. You
        agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person or entity by reason of our exercise
        of the rights granted in any Content posted by you or anyone else through your Membership account.</p>

        Services (or any part thereof) in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with the Terms.</p>

        PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF
        OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES) OR
        THE APP AND/OR ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
        AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
        CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS FOR ANY CAUSE

        to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>

      <h5>21. Other.</h5>
      <p>A delay or failure on our part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
        waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
        contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable
        from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. You may not
        assign or transfer these Terms or any of your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
        without our prior written consent. We may assign or delegate these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice.</p>
