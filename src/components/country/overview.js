                <h4>Why United Kingdom?</h4>
                <p>The UK is a bit damp and has trouble mustering up a season that looks and feels 
                like “summer,” but that only adds to its charm. With an umbrella and some wellies, 
                you can plan a great visit at almost any time of year. If you are looking to take 
                advantage of the national network of walking trails or spend time at the seaside, 
                July and August are usually the months that see the most sun, but daytime temps don’t 
                get much above 70°F (21°C) so the space in your suitcase would be better used for 
                light sweaters than shorts and bathing suits. Winter is cool but not arctic cold, 
                so this is a great time to get some off-season deals and get a taste of local British 
                culture from inside a warm pub. If you're headed up to Scotland, be prepared for 
                everything to be just that much colder, snowier and darker than in the south of England.</p>
